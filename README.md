# On Mapping the Freshwater Fish Population in Norway: the _FreshCatch_ iOS App 
#### Gathering the Data Basis
 
 Gathering data on the types of freshwater fish caught in various rivers and lakes throughout Norway. The goal is to collect information about where to fish for specific types of freshwater fish. This effort lays the groundwork for the data to be utilized in the _FreshCatch_ iOS application, which is under development.


##### Note that this data is aggregated by examining _registered_ freshwater fish catches in the Artsdatabanken database, interpolating the locations of these catches with the outlines of lakes and rivers in Norway (from NVE). Therefore, it is assumed that this data is not representative and likely lacks information on existing freshwater fish species in certain lakes and/or rivers.
